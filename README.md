# Women of STEM: Astronomy
[Available on Heroku](https://womenofstem.herokuapp.com/)

### Private forum made with Node, Express, Mongoose, EJS, HTML, and CSS. Follows MVC file structure and utilizes RESTFUL routes and CRUD.
For women in astronomy, this private, user-driven online community provides a safe sounding board to spread the word on relevant events and news, as well as ask for advice to help navigate the sometimes-choppy waters of being a woman in a STEM field.


### Unsolved Problems
  * As of now, submitting an application for membership automatically creates the login for immediate use. In the future this form will be sent to admins for approval.
  * enable commenting, "favorites", and private messaging
  * profile content needs different views for public and private
  * same with forum posts. These also need to be assigned to users(authors)
  * convert time to human readable format
